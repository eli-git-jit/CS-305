- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company. They wanted to improve the security of their web application by adding secure communication methods and ensuring the integrity of transferred data through a checksum verification process.

---

- What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I successfully identified and resolved several vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's web application. It’s crucial to code securely to protect sensitive client data and prevent malicious attacks. Software security ensures client trust and protects the company from potential demage

---

- Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging aspect was implementing HTTPS for secure communication. However, it helped me understand SSL certificates and secure communication protocols more thoroughly.

---

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased security by implementing HTTPS and using SHA-256 for checksum verification.

---

- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After refactoring the code, I conducted functional testing and used the dependency-check tool to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

---

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The dependency-check tool and the SHA-256 hash algorithm were valuable resources for this project. These tools will be useful in future assignments for ensuring security and integrity in software applications.

---

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show employers my work on refactoring the code to comply with security protocols, specifically implementing secure communications using HTTPS and ensuring data integrity with checksum verification.
